3. **API Documentation** - Swagger/OpenAPI integration
4. **Async Error Wrapper** - Reduce try-catch boilerplate

### 🟡 HIGH (Following Sprint)
5. **Input Validation** - Apply Joi to all routes
6. **Database Optimization** - Query caching, indexes
7. **Frontend State Management** - Redux/Zustand for scaling
8. **Enhanced Logging** - Structured logging with context

### 🟢 MEDIUM (Next Quarter)
9. **Monitoring Dashboard** - Prometheus + Grafana
10. **API Versioning** - Support future changes
